# Resilient Routes
An infrastructure resilience web application to integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) for GIS visualization to analyze seismic reliability of highway bridge systems. This webapp is in collaboration with the Quantification Uncertainty Group at UIUC. Two datasets have been completed, including bridge networks for the Bay Area and traffic networks for Anaheim and Sioux Falls.
